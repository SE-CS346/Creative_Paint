\chapter{External Interface Requirements}
On clicking the share button of the image, different options (whatsapp, facebook, instagram) to share that particular image appears.

\section{User Interfaces}
The system shall provide a very intuitive and simple interface to the user and the administrator, so that the user can easily navigate through the modes, levels and layouts.
The interface is very easy to use and will have tutorials for using along with it.
Apart from the hardware, software and communication interfaces, no other specific interface is required 

\section{Hardware Interfaces}
The application has no designated hardware so there are no direct hardware interfaces.

\section{Software Interfaces}
The game will run on all devices supporting Android 7.0[Nougat, API 24] and above.

\section{Communications Interfaces}
Only communication interface is the internet. It allows the user to share his/her art on social media.

\chapter{Nonfunctional Requirements}

\section{Performance Requirements}
Better and higher RAM will help in loading the pages instantly. Atleast 512MB of RAM is preferred.

\section{Availability}
The system will be available for use whenever the user deems necessary 24/7. The system shall allow users to restart the application after failure of the app with the earlier user saved works and settings.

\section{Maintainability}
The system will be updatable from software patches available through the App Store. Updates can be downloaded through the standard Android interface. Any discrepancies will be addressable by any developer as the coding will be done according to the coding standards of IEEE.

\section{Portability}
Since the app is developed using the android studio, it will run on any android device and windows supporting android applications.
The paint software can be used on any Android phone satisfying the minimum hardware/software dependencies as specified in this SRS document previously. Installation of this application can be done through the standard Android File Manager, and this application can be shared through an APK file between devices.

\section{Reliability}

\begin{itemize}[itemsep=0.5pt]
    \item The software will be able to run 99\% of the time when launched.
    \item There is a potential for errors relating to the state of the operating system that could prevent the game from launching (for example not enough resources available, etc.). The chance of such an occurrence is at most 1\%.
    \item The application will stop running if sent to run in the background, or the phone is accidentally powered off.
    \item The system will not be prone to errors caused by unexpected input.
\end{itemize}

\section{Usability}

\subsection{Contextual Inquiry (CI)}
\vspace{-2pt}
One member from our team observed his 7 year old relative and another member did for his 9 year old neighbour. We set up our contextual enquiry in the following format. One of the contextual inquiry can be considered as active and another one as passive.
\vspace{-2pt}
\begin{enumerate}[itemsep=0.5pt]
    \item \textbf{Plan} \\ 
     One of the sessions was physical and the other one was a recorded one.
     The goals of the session are planned as below:
    \begin{enumerate}[itemsep=0.5pt]
        \item How do children learn to draw ?
        \item Main difficulty faced in drawing ?
        \item Preferred way of learning art by child ?
        \item How interested or enthusiastic is the child about art ?
    \end{enumerate}
    
    \item \textbf{Initiate} \\
    We took permission from our relatives regarding taking the feedback from their children. We had set up sessions of about 90 minutes each where the children did not formally know about it. The overall environment of the child was not disturbed and the interaction was casual yet professional.
    
    \item \textbf{Execute}
    \begin{enumerate}[itemsep=0.5pt]
        \item Recording the observations
        \item Asking relevant queries and clarifications
    \end{enumerate}

    \hline \hline
    \textbf{Context of use} & Primarily for school work, not interested in art in general. & Keen interest in art, uses this as a leisure and hobby activity. \\ \hline
    \textbf{Pain points and issues in physical drawing} & Not getting hooked to it, difficulty in learning because of handling of material  & Difficulty in handling material \\ \hline
    \textbf{Imagination and creativity} & Good at imagining & He faces difficulty in drawing completely on his own \\ \hline
    \textbf{Interest and Enthusiasm} & Not much enthusiasm in drawing as such in traditional method & Very much excited and enthusiastic about new prospects. \\ \hline
    \textbf{Parents interference and support} & Parents do not want to give exposure to smartphones at this age. & Parents do not have time to monitor whether their child is learning properly. \\ \hline
    \textbf{Software, Applications} & Uses smartphones under parents guidance. & Uses various applications and is quite familiar with digital learning. \\ \hline
    \end{tabular}

    \item \textbf{Close}
            We thanked them for their cooperation and giving their ideas and suggestions regarding art.
